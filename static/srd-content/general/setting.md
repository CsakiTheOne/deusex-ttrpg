# Setting

## World, politics and important events

The world of Dues Ex is set in the near future, where cybernetic augmentations are a reality and the world is on the brink of a technological revolution. Some people are against the use of augmentations, while others see them as a way to improve their lives. The world has many organizations and factions, each with their own goals and motivations. Read more about them [here](../databases/factions.md).

Like any tabletop RPG, a campaign's story is up to the GM. However, the world of Deus Ex is rich with lore and history, so it's good to know about a few key events, for example the Aug Incident.

### The Aug Incident

> Minor spoilers for Deus Ex: Human Revolution.

[Wiki page](https://deusex.fandom.com/wiki/Aug_Incident)

In 2027, a signal was broadcast that caused augmented people to go into a violent frenzy. This event, known as the Aug Incident, caused the deaths of millions of people and led to the creation of the Human Restoration Act, which banned the use of augmentations. The Aug Incident is a key event in the world of Deus Ex, and its effects are felt years later.

A campaign can be set before, during or after the Aug Incident. That's for the GM to decide.

## Environment

The world of Deus Ex is a half-realistic cyberpunk setting. It's a world of neon lights and dark alleys. The world is divided into different regions, each with its own unique culture and history. The world is also filled with advanced technology, from cybernetic augmentations, automated security robots to mech suited police officers and advanced AI.

### Neural SubNet

The Neural SubNet, or NSN, is an advanced network that allows its users to communicate with each other in real time via virtual settings through the use of interfacing chairs and servers. The chair itself was developed by [Connaught Technologies](https://deusex.fandom.com/wiki/Connaught), but it is unclear if they also helped develop the NSN.
