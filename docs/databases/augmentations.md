## Basic info

### Activation

Activation tells the user when can they use an augmentation.

- Always-on: Always active and can't be turned off.
- Contextual: The aug only works in certain situations and the user has to activate it in that situarion.
- Automatic: The aug turns on (and off) automatically.
- Manual: The aug only turns on when the user activates it by hand / by will.

### Praxis and activation cost

The human body needs time and experience to get used to the cybernetics. The unit of measurement for this time and experience is praxis. The users can use praxis points to unlock / activate their augmentations.

## Built-in level

Everyone who is an aug, has all these cybernetics. Users can choose to not have some of these, but it greatly impacts their character's abilities.
