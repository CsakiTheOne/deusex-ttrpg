# Systems Reference Document

This document is a reference for the systems used in the game. It is intended to be used by players and game masters alike to understand how the game works and how to interact with it.

## How does it work?

The game works very similarly to Dungeons and Dragons and other tabletop roleplaying games. The game master will describe the world and the players will interact with it by describing what they want to do. The game master will then determine the outcome of the action based on the rules of the game.
