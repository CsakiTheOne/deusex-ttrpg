# Stealth

If a player enters a restricted area, all nearby players and enemies (people, turrets, robots) have to roll initiative, even if there are no enemies in the area. (The players don't have to know that.) The enemies remain in a calm state and do what they would normally do in their turns.

Enemies enter an alert state if one of the following happens:

- they hear a loud noise (explosion, gunshot, etc.)
- they see a player during a turn (for example if a player moves and the movement requires to go through the enemy's field of view)
- they see a player in a camera feed
- they see something move unusually (a door opening without someone coming through, a light turning off, etc.)
- gets damaged by something which can not be traced back to a player (timed explosive, trap, smoke granade, etc.)

## Alert

If an enemy enters an alert state, the enemy goes to the location the triggering event happened and alerts every nearby enemy. The alert state lasts for a few turns. This depends on how many turns needed to search for the trigger for the enemies. If there are 2 rooms, 1 enemy in one of the rooms and a door opens, the alert state lasts for 2 turns so the enemy can search both rooms. Players with the Radar Alarm Timer augmentation can see the alert state timer.

## Detection

An enemy enters a detection state if one of the following happens:

- they see a player between turns (for example if a player moves and the final position is in the enemy's field of view)
- gets damaged by a player or something which can be traced back to a player (gunshot, frag granade, etc.)

In this case, the enemy alerts every nearby enemy and combat begins. Players don't have to roll initiative again. The turn order stays the same.
