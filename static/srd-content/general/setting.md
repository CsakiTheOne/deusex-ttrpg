### Neural SubNet

The Neural SubNet, or NSN, is an advanced network that allows its users to communicate with each other in real time via virtual settings through the use of interfacing chairs and servers. The chair itself was developed by [Connaught Technologies](https://deusex.fandom.com/wiki/Connaught), but it is unclear if they also helped develop the NSN.
