# Augmentations

The augs in this game are based on the ones found in `Deus Ex: Mankind Divided`.

[Wiki page](https://deusex.fandom.com/wiki/Augmentations_(DXMD))

## Basic info

Augmentations are cybernetic enhancements that the player can use to improve their character's abilities. Some of them just give passive bonuses, while others can be activated to give the player an advantage or do something special.

### Activation

Activation tells the user when can they use an augmentation.

- **Always-on**: Always active and can't be turned off.
- **Contextual**: The aug only works in certain situations and the user has to activate it in that situarion.
- **Automatic**: The aug turns on (and off) automatically.
- **Manual**: The aug only turns on when the user activates it by hand / by will.

### Praxis and activation cost

The human body needs time and experience to get used to the cybernetics. The unit of measurement for this time and experience is `praxis`. The users can use `praxis points` to unlock / activate their augmentations.

## Augmentations by level

- [Built-in level](#built-in-level): Everyone who is an aug, has all these cybernetics. Users can choose to not have some of these, but it greatly impacts their character's abilities.
- [Civilian level](#civilian-level): When someone creates a character and chooses to start as an aug, they automatically have access to civilian level cybernetics.
- [VIP / Medical level](#vip--medical-level)
- [Military level](#military-level)
- [Experimental level](#experimental-level): These are the most advanced and rare augmentations. These augs are not optimized for daily use, so the users have to disable some of their other augs to avoid overheating / overloading their systems.
